# ChatGPT-with-OpenAI-and-Python

This project focuses on using the OpenAI framework to create a mini chatgpt using Python. The use of the OpenAI framework allows us to quickly create a chatgpt that is both valuable and easy to use.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the OpenAI Mini Chatgpt, you must have a working version of Python 3 installed on your local machine. You will also need to have the OpenAPI package installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

Once you have the files, you will need to set up the environment in which your chatbot will run. This includes setting up the local and webhooks, and configuring the OpenAI package.

Finally, the code involves writing the commands for how the chatgpt should respond to user input. Once completed, test the chatgpt using the OpenAI provided tools.
